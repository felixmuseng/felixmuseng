### Hi there, I'm Felix👋

I'm a software developer who loves building cool stuff across the stack — web apps, mobile apps, backends, you name it. I don't like boxing myself into one language or framework, so I tend to bounce between whatever gets the job done — JavaScript, Python, C, Java... even a little Rust when I'm feeling fancy.

### 🔧 What I Do

- 🌐 Web apps (frontend & backend)
- 📱 Mobile development (iOS + Android)
- ☁️ Backend APIs, microservices, cloud stuff
- 🧪 Experimenting with new tools & frameworks
